My name is Japleen Dhillon and I am a Mathematics graduate. 
I am currentyly working as a Service manager at one of the companies.
Being a mathematics graduate, I would like to have a career in Finance because I really like playing with the numbers and I believe FINTECH is the best way.
The reason I've chosen this programme is because FINTECH is one of the most demanding fields these days. With the increasing demand of digital banking, I believe fintech would be the future of everything. The main reason of joing Fintech is eventually I would like to have my own cryptocurrency.
